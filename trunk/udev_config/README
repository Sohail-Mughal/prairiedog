This script creates UDEV rules in /etc/udev/rules.d. These rules tell the kernel to look for certain attributes in USB devices that are connected to your computer, spefically the Manufacturer and Product strings, and assign a name other than ttyUSBx. If you are connecting devices with an FTDI chipset, you can change these two fields using the software MProg (on Windows).

This has been done for the iRobot Create and the Hagisonic Stargazer that can be accessed via /dev/create and /dev/stargazer, respectively.
